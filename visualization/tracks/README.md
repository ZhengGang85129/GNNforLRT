|reconstruct_and_match_tracks.py| Provides the `reconstruct_and_match_tracks` utility function using DBSCAN for reconstructing track candidates.|
|visualize_gnn_efficiency_purity_detector.py| Visualizes GNN efficiency and purity over the detector's r-z profile.|
|visualize_reconstructed_tracks.py| Visualizes reconstructed tracks and ground truth matching, annotated with edge scores.|
|visualize_seed_quality.py|Visualizes seed quality metrics for initial track candidates. |
|plot_configuration.py| Defines plotting configuration settings for visualizations.|
|evaluate_tracking_observables.py | Plots tracking efficiency across collider observables, such as $p_T$, $\eta$, $d_0$, $z_0$, and pileup.|
|visualize_edge_filtering_ablation.py| Visualizes true and fake edge connections before and after the edge filtering stage.|
|analyze_raw_hit_distribution.py|This script analyzes and visualizes edge-related statistics from graph-based tracking outputs over different spatial regions of the detector.|
